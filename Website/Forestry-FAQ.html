        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>1. What is CBD?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a naturally occurring compound found in the cannabis plant. Unlike THC, another well-known 
          compound found in cannabis, CBD is not psychoactive, which means it does not produce the "high" typically associated with marijuana use.</p>
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>2. Is CBD legal in the US?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">CBD derived from hemp, a strain of the cannabis plant that contains less than 0.3% THC, was federally legalized in 2018 under the 
          Agricultural Improvement Act, also known as the Farm Bill. This means that CBD products derived from hemp are legal at the federal 
          level.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>3. What are the benefits of CBD?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">CBD has been studied for its potential therapeutic benefits including reducing anxiety, pain relief, improving sleep, neuroprotective 
          effects, and acne fighting properties.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>4. Does CBD get you high?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">No, CBD does not get you high. Unlike THC, which is the psychoactive compound found in cannabis that produces the "high" sensation, 
          CBD is not psychoactive and does not produce an intoxicating effect.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>5. How is CBD different from hemp oil?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">CBD is a compound found in the cannabis plant, and it is one of many cannabinoids. Hemp oil, on the other hand, is a product made from 
          the seeds of the hemp plant. CBD is extracted from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of the hemp plant, while hemp oil is made by cold-
          pressing the seeds of the hemp plant. CBD is often used for its potential health benefits, such as reducing anxiety and inflammation, 
          while hemp oil is often used as a dietary supplement or in cosmetic products. While both CBD and hemp oil come from the same plant, 
          they are different products with different uses and properties.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>6. What are the different types of CBD products?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">There are many different types of CBD products available on the market today. Some of the most common types are: tinctures, topicals, 
          capsules, edibles, vape cartridges, and isolate powder.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>7. Are there any side effects of using CBD?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">While CBD is considered safe, It's important to note that CBD can interact with certain medications, including blood thinners, 
          antidepressants, and antipsychotics. If you are taking any medication, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider before 
          using CBD to avoid potential interactions.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>8. How long does it take for CBD to take effect?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">The time it takes for CBD to take effect can vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual's body weight, metabolism, 
          and the method of consumption. On average, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour to feel the effects of CBD when taken orally. 
          The effects of inhaled  or topical CBD are typically felt within minutes of use.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>9. How long does the effect of CBD last?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">The duration of the effects of CBD can vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual's body weight, metabolism, and 
          dosage. However, the effects can typically last anywhere from 2 to 4 hours on average.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>10. Can CBD interact with other medications?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">Yes, CBD can interact with other medications in some cases. CBD is metabolized by the liver using the same enzymes as many prescription 
          and over-the-counter medications, which can lead to interactions. CBD can increase or decrease the effectiveness of other medications 
          by affecting how they are metabolized in the body.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>11. What is the difference between full-spectrum and isolate CBD?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">The main difference between the two is the presence of other cannabinoids and plant compounds in full spectrum CBD products. Full 
          spectrum CBD contains a range of other cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids that are naturally present in the cannabis plant. CBD 
          isolate, on the other hand, is a pure form of cannabidiol that has been isolated from all other plant compounds. This means that it contains only CBD and none of the other cannabinoids or terpenes found in the cannabis plant.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>12. What is THC?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant. It is the compound responsible for producing 
          the "high" or euphoric effect associated with marijuana use. THC works by binding to cannabinoid receptors in the brain and central 
          nervous system, causing changes in mood, perception, and cognitive function.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>13. What are the health benefits of THC?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">THC has been studied for its potential health benefits including: pain relief, reduced vomiting, appetite stimulation, improved sleep,  
          and treating anxiety and depression.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>14. Is THC legal in the US?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">The legal status of THC in the US depends on several factors, including the state in which it is being used and the purpose for which
           it is being used. In some states, THC is legal for medicinal purposes with a valid prescription or recommendation from a healthcare 
           provider. In a smaller number of states, THC is also legal for recreational use by adults aged 21 or older. However, the specific 
           regulations and requirements vary by state.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>15. What types of THC products are available?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">There are many different types of THC products, including dried flower, edibles, tinctures, concentrates, 
            and topicals. Each has its own unique method of consumption and effect.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>16. How is THC different from CBD?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">THC and CBD are two of the most well-known compounds found in the cannabis plant, but they have different effects on the body and mind. 
          Mainly, THC is psychoactive, meaning it can produce a "high" while CBD, on the other hand, is not.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>17. Are there any medical uses for THC?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">Yes, THC has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as chronic pain, nausea, and muscle 
            spasms. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before using THC for medical purposes.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>18. Does THC have any side effects?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">THC can have side effects at higher doses or when consumed frequently. Some common side effects of THC include: dry mouth, reed eyes, 
          increased heart rate, or anxiety.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class="w3-text-light-green"><strong>19. How long does the effect of THC last?</strong><p>
          <p style="margin:30px 90px">The duration of the effects of THC can vary depending on several factors, including the dose, method of consumption, and individual
           factors such as tolerance and metabolism. In general, the effects of THC can last from 2 to 6 hours.
        <p style="margin:30px 90px" class= "w3-text-light-green"><strong>20. How should cannabis products be stored?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:30px 90px">Cannabis products, should be stored properly to help preserve their potency and freshness. Here are some general tips for storing your 
        products: keep away from heat and light, store in airtight containers, and avoid moisture.
